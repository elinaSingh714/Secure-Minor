# Secure-Minor
## Objective
An application bot which creates a safe environment for children to interact freely online. This application can recognize possible online grooming cases by identifying the perverted messages.
## Overview
- Greater popularity of social networks gives rise to cyber-criminal activities conducted by Sexual Predators (SPs). Secure Minor is an application that can easily detect such messages using LSTM-RNN model which have an impresive ability in sequence data processing, particularly for language model building and and text classification.
- LSTM-RNN language model is applied to generate sentence vectors which are fed into another LSTM-RNN classifier , so as to capture suspicious conversations
- This software will be made into an extension that can be activated on any site and gives a warning message regarding the online treats.
## Project Justification
1. Detection of online threats
2.	Chatroom with Chatbot
3.	Warning messages if the messages are suspicious
4.	Generates responses on perverted messages
